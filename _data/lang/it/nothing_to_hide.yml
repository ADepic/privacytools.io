title: Privacy? I don't have anything to hide.
quote: >
        Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, 
        every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about
        invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always
        say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address.
        I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home
        is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the
        nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want
        to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read
        what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all,
        if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should
        have nothing to hide." <strong>Not a single person hsa taken me up on
        that offer</strong>
