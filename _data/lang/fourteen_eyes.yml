    title: Global Mass Surveillance - The Fourteen Eyes
    description: >
        The UKUSA Agreement is an agreement between the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to cooperatively collect, analyze, and share intelligence. Members of this group, known as the [Five Eyes](https://www.giswatch.org/en/communications-surveillance/unmasking-five-eyes-global-surveillance-practices), focus on gathering and analyzing intelligence from different parts of the world. While Five Eyes countries have agreed to [not spy on each other](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/an-exclusive-club-the-five-countries-that-dont-spy-on-each-other) as adversaries, leaks by Snowden have revealed that some Five Eyes members monitor each otherâ€™s citizens and [share intelligence](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa) to [avoid breaking domestic laws](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett) that prohibit them from spying on their own citizens. The Five Eyes alliance also cooperates with groups of third-party countries to share intelligence (forming the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes), however Five Eyes and third-party countries can and do spy on each other.
